Data import from DWD and CRU
================

## Description

This project is a short blueprint for scripts aimed at downloading
gridded climate data from several freely available sources to extract
values for plot coordinates.

Our PhD students often struggle with this task, so the scripts in this
folder aim at making the access simpler. On the long run, it is meant to
replace my [outdated tutorial](https://github.com/r-link/DWD_extract)
which was made practically obsolete by the `rdwd` package.

Note that the project is a work in progress (and probably not very
useful in its current form).
